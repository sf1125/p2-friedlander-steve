                <p>My humans here tell me that I am sweet as can be! They say I am extremely friendly,
                    sociable and loving! I absolutely love playing with other dogs. I really hope that one day
                    soon I can find a furever home; it's actually my dream! I really need a backyard
                    because I'm such an active girl that loves to run, play and explore. Can I come home
                    and be part of your family? I promise I'll love you furever!

                <p>Look, we all have our days. Some days I'm feeling a little extra, and others I'm
                    being my fun loving self. But that's what us Chihuahuas do! No matter what day though, we are always
                    go, go, go! I'd do best in a quiet, one-family home. I'm okay with kids, but not so much
                    with toddlers. They can get a little too rowdy for my liking. Ironic, right?

                <h2>Sugar</h2>
                <p>I live up to my namesake because I am the goodest boy! I'm very affectionate towards people, and I
                    LOVE to
                    play fetch with a tennis ball. I also love to play with toys; especially sqeaky toys! I would love
                    to be a lap
                    dog, but I might be a little on the big side for that. How about we compromise and I just cuddle up
                    to you
                    on the couch instead and we watch Animal Planet together instead? I'm very treat motivated, and I
                    get along
                    great with other dogs! I'd do best in a home with another dog. Have I mentioned that I'm great with
                    kids of all ages?
                    C'mon, you know you wanna adopt me!

                <h2>Callie</h2>
                <p>Hi! The humans at the shelter tell me I'm beautiful, but I really want you to agree so that you'll
                    adopt me!
                    All my kittens have been adopted, so now I'm ready to have my own home. I'm very gentle, but I'm
                    also shy. With
                    a little patience, I'll end up being your best friend. Once I open up a little bit, I become the
                    biggest cuddlebug!
                    I'm good around other cats, but I can be a little iffy around dogs. I am also a master at chasing
                    laser dots when its
                    playtime!

                <p>I'm new to Gimme Shelter, but I'm just starting to come out of my
                    shell a little bit. The reason is that I had my own home until recently, so I'm a little
                    bit confused. I'm very friendly, so I can't wait to join you at home and curl up on your lap! Come
                    visit me today,
                    I promise you we'll be best friends!

                <h2>Q.T.</h2>
                <p>The one thing I really love about Gimme Shelter is that they actually
                    have volunteer humans that help cats like me adjust and feel welcomed! They give us treats, pet us,
                    give scratches;
                    anything that helps us feel better and become adjusted. Come to think of it, I've got an idea!
                    How about I come with you to my new home, and you give me treats, pets and scratches! That sounds
                    like a fantastic idea!
